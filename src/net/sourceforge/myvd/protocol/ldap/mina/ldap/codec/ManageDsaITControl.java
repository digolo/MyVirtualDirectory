/**
 * Control which allows for the management of referrals and other DSA specific
 * entities without processing them: meaning the referrals are treated as
 * regular entries using this control. More information is available in <a
 * href="">RFC 3296</a>. Below we have included section 3 of the RFC describing
 * this control:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *  3.  The ManageDsaIT Control
 * 
 *   The client may provide the ManageDsaIT control with an operation to
 *   indicate that the operation is intended to manage objects within the
 *   DSA (server) Information Tree.  The control causes Directory-specific
 *   entries (DSEs), regardless of type, to be treated as normal entries
 *   allowing clients to interrogate and update these entries using LDAP
 *   operations.
 * 
 *   A client MAY specify the following control when issuing an add,
 *   compare, delete, modify, modifyDN, search request or an extended
 *   operation for which the control is defined.
 * 
 *   The control type is 2.16.840.1.113730.3.4.2.  The control criticality
 *   may be TRUE or, if FALSE, absent.  The control value is absent.
 * 
 *   When the control is present in the request, the server SHALL NOT
 *   generate a referral or continuation reference based upon information
 *   held in referral objects and instead SHALL treat the referral object
 *   as a normal entry.  The server, however, is still free to return
 *   referrals for other reasons.  When not present, referral objects
 *   SHALL be handled as described above.
 * 
 *   The control MAY cause other objects to be treated as normal entries
 *   as defined by subsequent documents.
 * </pre>
