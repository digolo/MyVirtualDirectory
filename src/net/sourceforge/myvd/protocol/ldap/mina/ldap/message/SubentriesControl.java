/**
 * The control for the visibility of subentries with search operations. For
 * convenience we attach section 3 from <a
 * href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3672.html"> RFC 3672</a> where the control
 * is defined:
 * 
 * <pre>
 *   3.  Subentries Control
 *  
 *   The subentries control MAY be sent with a searchRequest to control
 *   the visibility of entries and subentries which are within scope.
 *   Non-visible entries or subentries are not returned in response to the
 *   request.
 *  
 *   The subentries control is an LDAP Control whose controlType is
 *   1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.1.10.1, criticality is TRUE or FALSE (hence absent),
 *   and controlValue contains a BER-encoded BOOLEAN indicating
 *   visibility.  A controlValue containing the value TRUE indicates that
 *   subentries are visible and normal entries are not.  A controlValue
 *   containing the value FALSE indicates that normal entries are visible
 *   and subentries are not.
 *  
 *   Note that TRUE visibility has the three octet encoding { 01 01 FF }
 *   and FALSE visibility has the three octet encoding { 01 01 00 }.
 *   
 *   The controlValue SHALL NOT be absent.
 *   
 *   In absence of this control, subentries are not visible to singleLevel
 *   and wholeSubtree scope Search requests but are visible to baseObject
 *   scope Search requests.
 *   
 *   There is no corresponding response control.
 *   
 *   This control is not appropriate for non-Search operations.
 * </pre>
